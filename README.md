## Projects

### Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on XYZ Dataset

This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis on the XYZ dataset. Key steps include data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization to uncover patterns and insights.

### Project 2: Web Scraping and Data Cleaning

In this project, data is scraped from various web sources, followed by cleaning and organizing the data for further analysis. The focus is on handling messy data and transforming it into a structured format.

### Project 3: SQL Database Analysis

This project demonstrates querying and analyzing data stored in an SQL database. It covers complex queries, data aggregation, and reporting using SQL.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for all scripts and exercises.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for developing and running Python code.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **SQL**: Used for database querying and management.
